    <p>Dear {{ person_name }},</p>
    <p>Thanks for placing an order from {{ company.name }}. It's scheduled to ship on {{ s\
hip_date|date:"F j, Y" }}.</p>
    <p>Here are the cargos you've ordered:</p>
    <ul>
        {% for cargo in cargo %}
        <li>{{ cargo }}</li>{% endfor %}
    </ul>
    {% if ordered_warranty %}
    <p>Your warranty information will be included in the packaging.</p>
    {% else %}
    <p>
        You didn't order a warranty, so you're on your own when the products inevitably stop working.
    </p>
    {% endif %}
    <p>Sincerely,<br />{{ company }}</p>
